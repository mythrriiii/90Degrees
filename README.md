## 📍The Problem
We’ve all experienced the frustration of handing our phone to a friend for a photo, only to end up with hundreds of unusable pictures. Explaining your preferred angles can be awkward, and no matter how detailed the instructions, the result is often disappointing. The process is time-consuming and tedious, leaving you with less-than-perfect memories. 90° addresses this issue by providing real-time, AI-driven guidance for photographers, ensuring that every shot captures your best angles without the need for long explanations or repeated attempts.


## 🛠️The Solution
Use 90° to upload your favourite photos, get guidelines when taking photos, and end up with the perfect photos!


### 🤖What is 90°?
90° is an app that provides innovative photo solutions, allowing people to take the perfect photos based on the perfect angles.

### 📝What is the process?
The app interface is pretty straightforward and super user-friendly. Let's break it down step by step:

**Create an account:** Start by downloading our app and creating an account with your email.

**Upload new photos:** Upload all the photos you took. You can categorise them into our pre-made categories, such as “full body”, “half-body”, or you can also make your own category.

**Like your photos:** Sort through the uploaded photos and choose your favourites. Our machine learning program will learn your photos to provide you with the perfect guideline.

**Take new photos:** Open up the camera and try to take a picture. Guidelines appear on the screen to help as a visual aid to the person with the camera. All they need to do is make sure that you are within the guidelines and then click a bunch of pictures!


### 🧠Why does it work?
So how does 90° answer these [Problems](#the-problem)?

**Automated Angle Detection:** 90° uses AI to identify your best angles based on your preferences, ensuring every shot is your favourite.

**Customizable Preferences:** You can set up specific angles and framing preferences, so anyone using your phone will capture photos exactly how you want them, without long explanations.  

**Guided Photography:**  With real-time guidance, 90° directs the photographer to position the camera at the optimal angle, minimising the risk of bad shots.

**Time-Saving:** No more sifting through hundreds of unusable photos - 90° guarantees the perfect picture in fewer attempts.

**User-Friendly Interface:** The app is simple to use for both the subject and the photographer, ensuring a stress-free photo-taking experience.


### ✏️Design Thinking Process
Our thought process for developing 90° was driven by a user-centric approach, as we wanted to address the frustrations people experience when getting the perfect photo.

**1. Empathize:** Having experience with endless struggles to communicate our preferred angles and getting unsatisfactory results after multiple attempts really helped us get in the shoes of our app’s users.

**2. Define:** The core problem was how difficult it is to consistently capture flattering photos without wasting time and effort. This helped us focus on creating a solution that would make the photo-taking process intuitive and reliable for both users and photographers.

**3. Ideate:** Our team brainstormed multiple solutions to simplify the process. We explored using AI and machine learning to detect ideal angles, personalised user preferences, and real-time guidance for photographers.

**4. Prototype:** We built a functional prototype of 90°, integrating customizable preferences and guided photography features. This allowed us to test the major functionalities in a real-world setting.

**5. Test:** To make sure that our app runs seamlessly, we will be testing with more users and fine-tune the app based on the feedback we receive. We will gather feedback from multiple potential users, and make sure to address their needs effectively. Through such, we aim to be the app people can rely on to take their stress out of photography.

## 🔌The Tech
### 🖥️Backend

### 🖱️Frontend
Our front end comprised two distinct components: Figma and React Native.

In Figma, we crafted a prototype to visualize the app's design, focusing on branding and personal toolkit elements. React Native then materialized this prototype into our fully functional app.

### 📊MATLAB
MATLAB is what we used a lot of things....

## 💢Challenges

## 🚀Try it Out
Here’s the link to our Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/POstEeFOL4tMNcIxw6VO98/90-degrees?node-id=55-3&starting-point-node-id=55%3A3

If you want to run this yourself, clone the repository and run "npm install" in the server and app directories.
You can run the mobile app with "npm run start" and the server with "npm run dev."
For the server to work, you will likely need to create your own firebase project and link it with a JSON certificate.


## 🎯Target Audience
We made this app for anyone who wants good photos of themselves. Just download our app, select your favourites, and hand the phone over to anyone for the most perfect photo of your life.

## 🚀Future Prospects
- **Accessibility:** We want to make our app accessible to people hard of hearing and sight as we aim to include anyone in our target audience.
- **Automated lighting sensor:** We want to train the AI further so that it recognises good and bad lighting when taking photos.
- **Application to non-human objects:** We aim to add a feature where we let users know what the optimal angle is when taking photos that are non-human.
